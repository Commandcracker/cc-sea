# CC-SEA

> A self-extracting archive (SFX or SEA) is a computer executable program which contains compressed data in an archive file combined with machine-executable program instructions to extract this information on a compatible operating system and without the necessity for a suitable extractor to be already installed on the target computer. The executable part of the file is known as a decompressor stub.
>
> Self-extracting files are used to share compressed files with a party that may not necessarily have the software to decompress a regular archive. Users can also use self-extracting to distribute their own software.
